# Flappy Bird Level Editor
### Ever wanted to make your own Flappy Bird level?
 Well now you can!

 This game is a recreation of the famous Flappy Bird game that released on the app store in 2013, except that it has a level editor.

 This game is actually a remake of the Flappy Bird level editor I made on Scratch. The project did so good with it getting over 200,000 views. Due to Scratch being pretty limited, I decided to remake my project in something else... HaxeFlixel.
