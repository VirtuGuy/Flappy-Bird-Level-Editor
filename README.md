# Flappy Bird Level Editor
### Ever wanted to make your own Flappy Bird level?
 Well now you can!

 This game is a recreation of the famous Flappy Bird game that released on the app store in 2013, except that it has a level editor.

 This game is actually a remake of the Flappy Bird level editor I made on Scratch. The project did so good with it getting over 180 thousand views. Due to Scratch being pretty limited, I decided to remake my project in something else... HaxeFlixel.

# Compiling
 To be able to compile the game from its source code, you need to do the following steps.

 1. Install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).
 2. Run the following commands in a command prompt.
    * `haxelib install hmm`
    * `haxelib run hmm setup`
 3. Open the project in a command prompt and run the command `hmm install`.
 4. Keep that same command prompt open and run the command `lime test [target]` (Target being the platform. Ex. `windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `android`). If you want to just build the code without the game opening at the end, run `lime build [target]`. Sadly, compiling the code for the first time takes a little while depending on your computer speed. It could take up to 5 minutes, maybe 10, or maybe even an hour! If you have a problem with compiling the code, let me know in the issues page.
