That's right, you can add your own custom backgrounds!
With the same amount of control there is in making custom objects,
you have the ability to make custom backgrounds!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

"path": The image location of the bg element (from the images folder).
"scale": The scale of the bg element.
"y": The y position of the bg element (make null for automatic
positioning).
"scrollFactor": The scroll factor of the bg element (good for depth).
"foreground": If true, the element will appear in front of all the
game objects.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For a better understanding, I'd recommend taking a look at the
default.json file. At the moment, there isn't really a need for a
background editor due to the system being super basic.
